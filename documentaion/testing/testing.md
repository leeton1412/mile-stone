## DevTools

* Testing the responsiveness of the web app.
    * Major issues discovered with mobile nav. Time issues means this may not be rectified in time.
    * I used Bootstrap to ensure I have reactive columns on different screen sizes. As before some issues have been identified for fixing.
* Testing that the css is targeting the relevant html code.
    * As an outcome the webiste is responsive on all screen sizes.
* Console Debugging
    * As an outcome I was able to see whether my Javascript functions were being called and were executing properly by displaying a console.log value in my console.
    * I noted that a Favicon was missing and was able to fix this by adding a favicon script and images. 
    * I noted that there is an issue with checkout view, save_info not saving and preventing delivery information being save.
